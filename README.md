# cv_machine_learning

## Synopsis

`cv_machine_learning` contains the scripts for the machine learning component of the computer vision subteam for UMARV. 

## Motivation

Ideally, this algorithm will be able to detect white lane lines on asphalt, while using the camera feed of a ZED 2 Camera. We will use the UMARV Google Drive in order to hold the raw data files, as well as the training data for our machine learning algorithm.
